# smartDots

This project consist of a population af agents that are trying to reach a target. They "learn" how to do so using genetic algorithm.

By making this project I aimed to learn about genetic algorithm. I implemented it using ES6 classes in javascript and the p5 library.
It can be tested here : https://niklass08.github.io/smartDots/p5/genettic-algo/
